# SERCOM USART interrupt

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in USART mode to transfer data in a non-blocking manner.

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a UART in a non-blocking manner. The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It receives 10 characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.
